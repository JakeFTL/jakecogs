## Hey, I‚Äôm JakeFTL!

Welcome to `jakecogs`, my collection of custom cogs for [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot). I built these for my Mystic Gaming community to bridge our game servers‚Äîlike Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy and Arma Reforger‚Äîwith Discord, keeping everyone connected and in the loop. They‚Äôre tailored to our needs, but I‚Äôve made them flexible and well-documented so anyone can use or tweak them for their own servers. Feel free to grab them, play around, and make them yours!

## Current Cogs

### JKChatBridge
#### Overview
`JKChatBridge` links a **Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy (JKA)** server to Discord. It uses RCON and log monitoring (`qconsole.log`) to relay chat, track player events, and manage server status‚Äîall with a sleek, emoji-rich vibe.

#### Features
- **Two-Way Chat**: Send messages between Discord and JKA.
- **Server Status**: `!jkstatus` shows players, map, and mod.
- **Player Stats**: `!jkplayer <username>` for detailed stats.
- **Events**: Join/disconnect, duels, and restart notifications (e.g., "‚ö†Ô∏è Standby" and "‚úÖ Resumed").
- **Emoji Magic**: Converts text emotes (e.g., `:)` to üòä) and supports custom emojis.

#### Setup
1. Place `jkchatbridge.py` in `data/yourbotname/cogs/`.
2. Install: `pip install aiofiles`.
3. Load: `[p]load jkchatbridge`.
4. Configure (bot owner only):
   - `[p]jkbridge setchannel #channel`
   - `[p]jkbridge setrconhost 127.0.0.1`
   - `[p]jkbridge setrconport 29070`
   - `[p]jkbridge setrconpassword yourpass`
   - `[p]jkbridge setlogbasepath C:\path\to\lugormod`
   - `[p]jkbridge showsettings` to check.

#### Commands
- **All Users**: `!jkstatus`, `!jkplayer <username>`.
- **Admins**: `[p]jkexec <file>`, `[p]jkrcon <command>`, `[p]jktoggle` (join/disconnect messages).

#### Notes
- Built for Lugormod, tweak the log path for other mods.
- Windows-focused but adaptable.

### ArmaEvents
#### Overview
`ArmaEvents` connects an **Arma Reforger** server to Discord via the Server Admin Tools Events API. We use it for a DayZ game-mode, but its usable with any setup. It posts real-time updates for player joins, kills (player or zombie), and FPS drops.

#### Features
- **Event Posts**: Styled updates like ‚Äúüßç **[Arma] Jake** has rejoined the fight for survival!‚Äù or ‚Äúüßü **[Arma] Jake** got mauled by a zombie! üíÄ‚Äù.
- **Configurable**: Set everything via Discord commands.
- **DayZ Vibes**: Tailored for zombie survival servers.

#### Setup
1. Place `armaevents.py` in `data/yourbotname/cogs/`.
2. Install: `pip install websocket-client`.
3. Load: `!load armaevents`.
4. Configure (bot owner only):
   - `!arma setchannel #channel`
   - `!arma settoken yourtoken`
   - `!arma setaddress ws://localhost:8080/events`
   - `!arma showsettings` to verify.
5. In `ServerAdminTools_Config.json`:
   ```json
   "eventsApiToken": "yourtoken",
   "eventsApiAddress": "ws://localhost:8080/events",
   "eventsApiRatelimitSeconds": 10

#### Commands
| Command                  | Description                                   | Example                                     |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| !arma setchannel #chan   | Set the event channel.                        | !arma setchannel #arma-updates              |
| !arma settoken token     | Set the API token.                            | !arma settoken mysticDayZ2025               |
| !arma setaddress addr    | Set the WebSocket address.                    | !arma setaddress ws://localhost:8080/events |
| !arma showsettings       | Show current settings.                        | !arma showsettings                          |

##### Notes
- Requires Server Admin Tools mod on your Arma server.
- Token and address must match your server config.

#### Installation Basics
1. Red Bot Setup: Have Red Bot running (Python 3.8+).
2. Cog Folder: Drop cogs into data/yourbotname/cogs/.
3. Dependencies: Install via pip as noted above.
4. Load: Use [p]load cogname or !load cogname (depending on your prefix).

#### Why I Made These
I run Mystic Gaming, and we‚Äôre all about keeping our Discord buzzing with what‚Äôs happening in-game. JKChatBridge keeps our JKA crew chatting across platforms, while ArmaEvents tracks the chaos of our DayZ Reforged server‚Äîzombie maulings and all. I‚Äôve packed them with commands and docs so you can set them up easily, whether for Mystic Gaming or your own crew.

#### Contributing
These cogs are free for anyone to use or tweak. Fork the repo, open issues, or send pull requests if you‚Äôve got fixes or cool additions. I‚Äôve tried to keep the code clean and the commands intuitive‚Äîdive in and make it your own!

#### Troubleshooting
No Messages? Check settings with showsettings commands and ensure server configs match.

Errors? Peek at Red Bot‚Äôs logs (data/yourbotname/logs/) for clues.
